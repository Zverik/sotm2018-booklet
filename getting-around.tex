\section*{Getting around in Milan}
\label{getting-around}
\pagestyle{cropmarksstyle}
Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM) operates a public transport network in Milan. Single tickets cost
€~1.50 and are available from newsstands, tobacconists (tabaccherie), bars and automatic ticket
machines in metro stations. 24\,h (€~4.50) and 48\,h (€~8.25) tickets, as well as a \emph{carnet} of 10 single
trips (€~13.80) are also available. An evening ticket (€~3.00) allows unlimited travel after 20:00.

Tickets should be stamped at the start of every journey and every time you change vehicles. To stamp
your ticket insert it into the slot in the electronic ticket machine on board overground vehicles or
at the ticket barriers in the metro. It is then valid for 90 minutes unlimited use (bus or tram), or
the completion of your full metro journey. Tickets are not sold on board and you will not find a
self-service ticket machine at bus and tram stop.

If your journey starts with the Metro, you can also use contactless payment.
Fees are limited so that you do not pay more than the 24 hr rate on any day.
